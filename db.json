Also player can utilize defensive skills such as dodges or blocking attacks, and positioning to gain the upper hand in battle. This style is described as a hybrid of RPG and FPS (first person shooter) combat. Although this game's combat might also be said to take elements from Beat 'em up games. Iframes (invulnerability frames) are important concept adopted from these games. Iframe can make player invulnerable damage up to two seconds, which allows them dodge or avoid special attacks."
